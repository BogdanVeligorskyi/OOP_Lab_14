# OOP_Lab_14
Repository for the 14th lab from OOP (Об'єктно орієнтоване програмування)

In the process of development Java language, Eclipse IDE and Swing library were used.

Alongside with graphics test functions (marked as commented lines), this laboratory work had an individual task, where student needed to demonstarte use of graphics in Java.
I decided to create a program which shows current time in Ukraine. So, it uses a separate thread for time counting and graphical elements such as fonts, text style etc.
